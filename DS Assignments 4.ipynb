    "Pruning in decision trees is a process of reducing the complexity of the tree by removing nodes, branches, or sub-trees. It helps to avoid overfitting, where the tree becomes too specific to the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Pruning prevents excessive splitting and simplifies the decision tree by removing less informative or redundant nodes. It aims to strike a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy, promoting better generalization."
